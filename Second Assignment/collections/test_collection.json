{"title": "Costs and benefits of implementing child survival services at a private mining company in Peru.", "issue": "81(8)", "pages": "1055-7", "abstract": "Costs and savings of child health services were studied in a private mining company in Peru. Despite considerable outlays for medical services, few children under age 5 were vaccinated, and half of their illnesses went untreated. Children who were attended at the company clinic usually received unnecessary medication. As a result of the study, the company hired additional staff to provide integrated maternal-child preventive health care and family planning and contracted for intensive training and periodic on-site supervision. In less than 2 years, vaccination coverage reached 75%, and virtually all children under age 1 were enrolled in growth monitoring. Prescriptions were reduced by 24%, including a 67% drop in antimicrobials. The cost of the new services was $13,200 for the first 2 years. Approximately $6800 has been saved in pharmaceuticals prescribed for respiratory infection and diarrhea. Recently, two more mines adopted maternal and child health and family planning services. It is hoped that cost-benefit arguments will encourage other companies to incorporate aggressive child survival measures into their health plans.", "journal": "American journal of public health", "authors": "Foreit|K G|KG|;Haustein|D|D|;Winterhalter|M|M|;La Mata|E|E|", "pubdate": "1991", "pmid": "1854001", "mesh_terms": "D002662:Child Health Services; D002675:Child, Preschool; D003365:Costs and Cost Analysis; D004363:Drug Utilization; D006801:Humans; D007223:Infant; D007231:Infant, Newborn; D008906:Mining; D009786:Occupational Health Services; D010568:Peru; D014611:Vaccination", "publication_types": "D016428:Journal Article; D013485:Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486:Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "chemical_list": "", "keywords": "", "doi": "10.2105/ajph.81.8.1055", "references": "", "delete": false, "affiliations": "Futures Group, Washington, DC 20005-5601.", "pmc": "", "other_id": "", "medline_ta": "Am J Public Health", "nlm_unique_id": "1254074", "issn_linking": "0090-0036", "country": "United States"}

In experiment 1, urine collected by cystocentesis prior to electroejaculation was azoospermic or contained few, nonmotile spermatozoa, whereas urine collected after electroejaculation contained more (P = 0.002) spermatozoa, and motile spermatozoa were evident in urine obtained from 6 of 8 cats. Administration of methoxamine hydrochloride (200 micrograms/kg of body weight, IV) did not affect spermatozoal output or percentage of retrograde flow. Percentage of retrograde flow for control cats ranged from 61.18 to 92.95% (mean +/- SD, 80.00 +/- 14.28%) and for methoxamine-treated cats, ranged from 15.25 to 92.49% (mean +/- SD, 58.10 +/- 32.28%), but the difference was not significant.

{"title": "Conformation of an enzyme-bound substrate of staphylococcal nuclease as determined by NMR.", "issue": "30(30)", "pages": "7425-37", "abstract": "The dinucleoside phosphodiester dTdA is a slow substrate of staphylococcal nuclease (kcat = 3.8 X 10(-3) s-1) that forms binary E-S and ternary E-M-S complexes with Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and La3+. The enzyme enhances the paramagnetic effects of Co2+ on 1/T1 and 1/T2 of the phosphorus and on 1/T1 of six proton resonances of dTdA, and these effects are abolished by binding of the competitive inhibitor 3',5'-pdTp. From paramagnetic effects of Co2+ on 1/T2 of phosphorus, koff of dTdA from the ternary E-Co(2+)-dTdA complex is greater than or equal to 4.8 X 10(4) s-1 and kon greater than or equal to 1.4 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, indicating the 1/T1 values to be in fast exchange. From paramagnetic effects of enzyme-bound Co2+ on 1/T1 of phosphorus and protons, with use of a correlation time of 1.6 ps on the basis of 1/T1 values at 250 and 600 MHz, 7 metal-nucleus distances and 9 lower-limit metal-nucleus distances are calculated. The long Co2+ to 31P distance of 4.1 +/- 0.9 A, which is intermediate between that expected for direct phosphoryl coordination (3.31 +/- 0.02 A) and a second sphere complex with an intervening water ligand (4.75 +/- 0.02 A), suggests either a distorted inner sphere complex or the rapid averaging of 18% inner sphere and 82% second sphere complexes and may explain the reduced catalytic activity with small dinucleotide substrates. Seventeen interproton distances and 108 lower limit interproton distances in dTdA in the ternary E-La(3+)-dTdA complex were determined by NOESY spectra at 50-, 100-, and 200-ms mixing times. While metal-substrate and interproton distances alone did not yield a unique structure, the combination of both sets of distances yielded a very narrow range of conformations for enzyme-bound dTdA, which was highly extended, with no base stacking, with high-anti glycosidic torsional angles for dT (64 degrees less than or equal to chi less than or equal to 73 degrees) and dA (66 degrees less than or equal to chi less than or equal to 68 degrees) and predominantly C-2'-endo sugar puckers for both nucleosides. Although the individual nucleosides are like those of B-DNA, their unstacked conformation, which is inappropriate for base pairing, as well as the conformational angles alpha and gamma of dA and zeta of dT, rule out B-DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "journal": "Biochemistry", "authors": "Weber|D J|DJ|;Mullen|G P|GP|;Mildvan|A S|AS|", "pubdate": "1991", "pmid": "1854746", "mesh_terms": "D002118:Calcium; D003035:Cobalt; D004277:DNA, Single-Stranded; D015226:Dinucleoside Phosphates; D007700:Kinetics; D007811:Lanthanum; D009682:Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; D008345:Manganese; D008836:Micrococcal Nuclease; D008958:Models, Molecular; D009690:Nucleic Acid Conformation; D010758:Phosphorus; D011994:Recombinant Proteins; D013210:Staphylococcus", "publication_types": "D016428:Journal Article; D013485:Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486:Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487:Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "chemical_list": "D004277:DNA, Single-Stranded; D015226:Dinucleoside Phosphates; D011994:Recombinant Proteins; C028145:2'-deoxythymidylyl-(3'-5')-2'-deoxyadenosine; D010758:Phosphorus; D003035:Cobalt; D008345:Manganese; D007811:Lanthanum; D008836:Micrococcal Nuclease; D002118:Calcium", "keywords": "", "doi": "10.1021/bi00244a009", "references": "", "delete": false, "affiliations": "Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.", "pmc": "", "other_id": "", "medline_ta": "Biochemistry", "nlm_unique_id": "0370623", "issn_linking": "0006-2960", "country": "United States"}

We sought to obtain such antibodies against the type 1 receptor for melatonin (MT1). For this, we injected mice with CHO cells transfected with a plasmid encoding human MT1 (CHO-MT1-h), in the presence or absence of an adjuvant mixture containing Alum and CpG1018. As we previously observed that the immune response to a protein antigen is increased when it is coupled to a fusion protein, called 10ZZTat1, we also investigated if the association of ZZTat101 with CHO-MT1-h cells provides an immunogenic advantage. We measured similar levels of anti-CHO and anti-MT1-h Ab responses in animals injected with either CHO-MT1-h cells or /CHO-ZZTat101MT1-h cells, with or without adjuvant, indicating that neither the adjuvant mixture nor ZZTat101 increased the anti-cell immune response. Then, we investigated whether the antisera also recognized murine MT1 (MT1-m). Using cloned CHO cells transfected with a plasmid encoding MT1-m, we found that antisera raised against CHO-MT1-h cells also bound the mouse receptor. Altogether our studies indicate that immunizing approaches based on MT1-h-expressing CHO cells allow the production of polyclonal antibodies against MT1 receptors of different origins.
